Assignment:

Task 1:
Write a function which calculate the sum of digits.
e.g. input = 2345 , output of the function would be 2+3+4+5 which is 14.
Implement the same function using recursion , don’t search on google try your self.

Task 2:
Write a function which takes string as an argument and returns reformatted string based on a condition.
e.g.  I create a function called  reformat_string(input_string, condition) , and call the method like
reformat_string(“hey how are you”, “reverse”) , this will return 'uoy era woh yeh’
reformat_string(“hey how are you”, “split”) , this will return an array ['hey', 'how', 'are', 'you’]
reformat_string(“hey how are you”, “upper case”), this will return a string ‘HEY HOW ARE YOU’
reformat_string(“hey how are you”, “multiply by 3”), this will return a string ‘hey how are you hey how are you hey how are you’
reformat_string(“       hey how are you      ”, “strip”), this will return a string ‘hey how are you’ i.e. remove left and right spaces.
reformat_string(“hey how are you”, “slicing”), this will return a string ‘hey are you’

Task 3:
Tom and jerry are playing game with two dice.  Score of the game is the sum of number shown on the two dices. e.g. one dice shows 6, and other 6 thus out put score is 12.
1)Print all the combination of dices score possible, e.g. 
       possible dice score are : ( 6|2), (5|1), ….. and so on
2)One of the dice is got broken such that it does not have face showing 6 and face showing 1, print the possible score like in 1) with this condition in mind.
Optional
3)   Some how, Tom starts cheating and every other time he throws the dice, the number on one of them is always even. Print one such  possible set of scores ( combination of numbers that shows on the dices) thrown by Tom in 10 consecutive trails.
